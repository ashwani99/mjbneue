#### This is a repo for my exercise projects, before they (hopefully) hive off into larger things.

Iâ€™m using this to test and practice my budding Markdown, Git & Python skills.

`gm.py` is currently the only project.  
It guides you along a little story about the Golden Mean.    
Requires Python 3.6 to run.
